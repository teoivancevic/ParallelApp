# Parallel - national competition

## Overview

Parallel is not an ordinary application; it's designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Progressive web applications are made to function on a wide range of browsers. For mobile use, it doesn't need to be published on Google Play Store or Apple Store; it can be added as an application from the browser to the home screen.

### Authors

The project is developed by a team of three students from the natural science and mathematics school XV. gimnazija in Zagreb. The team consists of Teo Ivančević, Domagoj Sabolić, and Fran Horvat, all seniors in the computer science track. They decided to create a better solution for information transfer during online classes.

- **Teo Ivančević**: Focused on coding Parallel, with interests in algorithms.
- **Domagoj Sabolić**: Interested in cybersecurity, responsible for authentication and authorization of users.
- **Fran Horvat**: Focused on the design of the application, creating wireframes, and prototypes.
